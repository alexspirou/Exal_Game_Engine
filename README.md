# Humans Vs Meteors

This project is only for practicing my C++ skils. A lot of things
I do on my own way and I don't follow a procedure which used for making
SDL Games. The game is under constuction.

## Game logic
You control an aircraft which can be moved in x,y axis. The main purpose of the game is to collect 4 green symbols, I called them energies, while you're avoiding the meteors which are moved at x axis.
